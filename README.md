# turnt-octo-robot - DEPRECATED
This was my first repository, and I wasn't sure what to call it. I also attempted to make this a portfolio; call it the 6th version of my portfolio.

# History
The original project was made many years ago with Photoshop slices. If you're unfamiliar with that concept, it is when the web designer takes a photoshop file and slices it into HTML tables. While much different from the 1st iteration, the 6th iteration uses grails as framework to assist me.

# Goals
* The main goal is to display all of my accomplishments.
* The aim of this project is to showcase any projects and/or the activities I have done or am doing currently.
* This project is meant to show both breadth and depth, and therfore shows elements of my history that are less than perfect.
* It is meant to show a whole picture of who I am, but it also focuses the viewer by provided different roles.

# Notes
* This is an unreleased version of the nathanielbuechler.com website. 
* To see early attempts at my front-end development, you'll need to be able to run a JVM and you'll need other grails dependencies, too.
* It has the name 'turnt-octo-robot' because I didn't understand naming conventions when I was first learning about software development. Now, the name is an artifact of a depricated project.

# Lessons Learned
* Grails, at the time (2013), was overly complicated for a simple web application. I didn't need a database, a schema, GORM objects, a front-end gsp view resolution, and a groovy language built in. I also didn't know I was overwhelmed with tools, but it was a great learning experience being 'thrown into the deep end' of the 'technology pool.'
* I wanted to figure out how to deploy a simple web app, and this was my first attempt. I learned at the time all of the steps that go into deploying an application, and it set a nice foundation for me.
* It's version 6 of the portfolio, and unreleased because I never finished this due to time constraints and the complexity of deploying an application and writing the code for it. I skipped to version 7 which was simple HTML and JS.
* So, I also learned what over-engineering really means, and I'm now much more cautious when choosing technologies to use. The more technologies, the more room for error. Lessons learned.
