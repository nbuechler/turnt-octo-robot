# turnt-octo-robot
first repository and also a portfolio

An unreleased version of the nathanielbuechler.com website. Just don't look at this unless you want to see early attempts at front end development.

#Lessons Learned.

-Grails is overly complicated, at least this version of it was. Who knows what its like now?

-I wanted to figure out how to deploy a simple web app, and this was my first attempt. It's version 6 of the portfolio, and unreleased because I never finished this. I skipped to version 7 which was simple HTML and JS.

-So, I also learned what over-engineering meant. Lessons learned.
